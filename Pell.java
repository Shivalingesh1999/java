/*35.Java program to print the first 15 numbers of the Pell series.*/

/*the Pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers. 
The sequence of Pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and 
then each Pell number is the sum of twice the previous Pell number and the Pell number before that.
: thus, 70 is the companion to 29, and 70 = 2 Ã— 29 + 12 = 58 + 12*/
